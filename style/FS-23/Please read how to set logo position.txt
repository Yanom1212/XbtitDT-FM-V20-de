to set and position your logo find in main.css

.logo1 {
  background:url("images/logo.png") no-repeat;  
  height:100px; 
  width:100%;
  margin: auto;
  background-position: 100% 60%;
}

This is for the logo image used replace the logo.png image or if you use .gif .jpg change to suit your logo needs (ie logo.jpg).
background:url("images/logo.png") no-repeat; 


This is for the position of the logo the first 100% is for the left and right margin if you set it lower it will float more left as you decrease the number. 
the second 50% is the height of the logo if you set 40% it will display higher and 60% will make it float lower in the logo area.

background-position: 100% 60%;
