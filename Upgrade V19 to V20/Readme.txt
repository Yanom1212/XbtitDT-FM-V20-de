How to upgrade from V19 to V20

always backup first !!

warning , this need te be done in V19 before you do anything else !

ftp the hack [SQL Upgrade V19 V20] to you hacks folder 
chmod the hack 777
go to acp hacks and install the hack 

this will insert all new SQL to your database

un install all other hacks !! 
you need to install them again after the upgrade , else code will be missing in the clean files from V20 

now take away 2 files from V20 folder
include/settings.php
install.php

FTP all new files to your server ( overwrite )

----------------------------------------------

Importend ! after the upgrade check and adjust:

tracker settings , as many new options are added , hit confirm in settings for sure

That is all ;)
